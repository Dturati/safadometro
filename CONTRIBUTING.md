- You must be listening to the [music](http://www.vagalume.com.br/marcos-e-belutti/aquele-um-por-cento-part-wesley-safadao.html) while coding.
- You **MUST BE** listening to the [music](http://www.vagalume.com.br/marcos-e-belutti/aquele-um-por-cento-part-wesley-safadao.html) while coding.

1. Just think of your own interpretation of the problem.
1. Check if anyone has suggested this before [here](https://github.com/mabrasil/safadometro/pulls).
1. Fork this project!
1. Create a new folder with the name of the language you've used in your solution, e.g. `javascript/`.
1. If the language you want to implement already has an implemention, make `version-*` in the folder!
1. **Put the implementation and the example in separated files**.
1. Tick the language - with `- [x]` in *GitHub Flavored Markdown* - in which
you've implemented [here](STATUS.md).
1. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add JavaScript version'`.
1. Push to the branch: `git push origin master`.
1. Submit a pull request :)

> If you'd like to contribute with a language in which the algorithm has already
been implemented - but you have a *new/special/different/whatever* way of making -,
you can make it! Just create a new folder inside the folder of the language, e.g.
`javascript/browser`, `javascript/node`, `javascript/react` etc.

### Adding a New Language

1. Check if anyone has suggested this before [here](https://github.com/mabrasil/safadometro/pulls).
